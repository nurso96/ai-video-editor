# Project Status: AI Video Editor

## 1. Overall Objective

The primary goal is to create a full-stack, web-based video editor that leverages AI to simplify the creation of short-form, social-media-style videos. The application should allow users to upload clips, have them automatically analyzed for key features (like speech and beats), edit them on a timeline, and render a final video with AI-suggested effects and captions.

## 2. How Close Are We?

The project is currently at a **functional prototype** stage. The core end-to-end workflow—from video upload to rendering—is implemented. However, the application is not yet production-ready. It serves as an excellent proof-of-concept but requires significant refinement in terms of stability, user experience, and test coverage to be considered a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## 3. Key Milestones Achieved

*   **Core Workflow Implemented:** Users can upload a video, have it analyzed by the backend, see it in an editor, and trigger a render job.
*   **AI Tool Integration:** The frontend successfully communicates with backend AI services for transcription, beat detection, and effect suggestions.
*   **Significant Frontend Refactoring:** The initial monolithic frontend architecture has been vastly improved:
    *   **Centralized State Management:** Implemented `Zustand` to manage application state, making the UI more predictable and easier to debug.
    *   **Dedicated API Layer:** Created a reusable API client with `axios`, abstracting away direct `fetch` calls.
    *   **Centralized Data Models:** All core data types are now located in `src/types`, improving type safety and code organization.
*   **Component-Based UI:** Started breaking down large pages like `editor.tsx` into smaller, more manageable components (e.g., `VideoPreview.tsx`).

## 4. Current Focus Areas

Our immediate focus has been on **improving the frontend's architectural foundation**. The recent refactoring efforts were critical for setting the project up for long-term success, making it easier and safer to add new features.

## 5. Blockers & Risks

*   **Critical Risk: No Test Coverage:** The lack of automated tests (unit, integration) is the single biggest risk to the project. Every new feature or refactor has the potential to break existing functionality without us knowing. This will slow down development velocity and erode stability over time.
*   **Backend Invisibility:** As a frontend engineer, I have no visibility into the backend's stability, performance, or deployment status. Any issues on the backend will directly block frontend progress.
*   **Monolithic Components:** While we've made progress, some components still manage too much logic and could be broken down further to improve reusability and testability.

## 6. Next Steps

To move the project towards a stable MVP, I strongly recommend the following ordered steps:

1.  **Establish a Testing Framework:** Set up Jest and React Testing Library to enable unit and integration testing. This is a non-negotiable step for building a reliable application.
2.  **Write Initial Unit Tests:** Begin by writing tests for our `editorStore` and critical UI components to lock in their behavior.
3.  **Set Up CI/CD:** Create a basic Continuous Integration pipeline (e.g., with GitHub Actions) that automatically runs linting and testing on every code change.
4.  **Continue UI/Component Refinement:** Continue breaking down complex components and improving the user experience of the editor.
